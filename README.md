# Advanced Car Dealership Project

## Description of the Advanced Car Dealership Project

The Advanced Car Dealership project is a basic Java program designed to manage a car dealershipâ€™s inventory.
It provides users with an easy way to add new cars, remove cars, view all available vehicles,
and search by specific criteria such as brand like Mercedes.
The program also allows users to create sales or lease contracts for vehicles.
Car data is stored in a CSV file, making it easy to update and retrieve vehicle records.


## User Stories


1. As a user, I want to list all vehicles in the inventory, so that I can explore the car options.
2. As a user, I want to add a new vehicle to the inventory, so that I can manage the car inventory.
3. As a user, I want to remove old vehicles from the inventory, so that I can manage the car inventory.
4. As a user, I want to search for vehicles by price in the inventory, so that I can look for car options according to my budget.
5. As a user, I want to search for vehicles by year in the inventory, so that I can filter cars within my age threshold.
6. As a user, I want to search for vehicles by color in the inventory, so that I can choose my favorite car.
7. As a user, I want to search for vehicles by mileage range in the inventory, so that I can see less-used cars.
8. As a user, I want to search for vehicles by type in the inventory, so that I can see car options such as SUV, van, or truck.
9. As a user, I want to create a lease contract for a vehicle, so that I can lease the vehicle for a specified period with a monthly payment. 
10. As a user, I want to create a sale contract for a vehicle, so that I can purchase the vehicle outright with a one-time payment.
## Setup

Instructions on how to set up and run the project using IntelliJ IDEA.

### Prerequisites

- IntelliJ IDEA: Ensure you have IntelliJ IDEA installed, which you can download from [here](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/).
- Java SDK: Make sure Java SDK is installed and configured in IntelliJ.

### Running the Application in IntelliJ

Follow these steps to get your application running within IntelliJ IDEA:

1. Open IntelliJ IDEA.
2. Select "Open" and navigate to the directory where you cloned or downloaded the project.
3. After the project opens, wait for IntelliJ to index the files and set up the project.
4. Find the main class with the `public static void main(String[] args)` method.
5. Right-click on the file and select 'Run 'CarDealerShip.main()'' to start the application.

## Future Work

A future feature could allow users to trade in option for their old vehicle. This would require a CSV file to store average vehicle values,
which would be used to calculate the trade-in value and adjust the sales or lease price.
